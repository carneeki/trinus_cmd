This is a clone of the handy (for Linux and maybe Windows/MacOS) Trinus command
line utility by Mike Nix.

I was unable find this tool online anymore.

This is not the original source, I made a few changes to provide % progress of
prints while printing (I think that's the change I made?).

Mike, if you're reading this and you'd like me to remove the utility, please
contact me!
